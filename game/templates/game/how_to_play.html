    <h1>How to Play Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>
    
    <div class="rules-container">
    <h2>Basic Concept</h2>
    <p>Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is a more complex version of classic Tic-Tac-Toe, consisting of 9 smaller Tic-Tac-Toe boards arranged in a 3×3 grid (making a total 9×9 play area).</p>

    <h2>Game Rules</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Board Structure:</strong> There are 9 small 3×3 boards that make up one large 3×3 board.</li>
        <li><strong>First Move:</strong> The first player can place their mark (X or O) in any small square of any small board.</li>
        <li><strong>Subsequent Moves:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Wherever you place your mark determines which small board the next player must play in</li>
                <li>For example, if you play in the center square of a small board, your opponent must play in the center small board of the large grid</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Winning Small Boards:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Win a small board by getting 3 in a row (like regular Tic-Tac-Toe)</li>
                <li>Once a small board is won, it's marked as belonging to that player in the large grid</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Forced Boards:</strong> If you're sent to a small board that's already won or full, you get to play in any other small board of your choice.</li>
        <li><strong>Winning the Game:</strong> Win the ultimate game by winning 3 small boards in a row on the large grid (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Special Cases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If a small board ends in a draw, it counts for neither player in the large grid</li>
        <li>If the entire game ends with no player achieving 3 small boards in a row, the winner is determined by who won the most small boards</li>
    </ul>
